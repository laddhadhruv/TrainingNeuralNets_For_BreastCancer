# TrainingNeuralNets_For_BreastCancer
This repository contains the implementation of a neural-network-based classifier trained on the **Multi-Cancer Dataset** from Kaggle. The project explores preprocessing, model architecture, training workflow, and performance evaluation for cancer prediction. Accuracy is over 95% over 2500+ test images.
